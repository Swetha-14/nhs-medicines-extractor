# NHS Medicines Extractor

## Problem Statement

### Criteria
The NHS has a list of medicines. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to extract this information into a JSON bundle.  

The JSON bundle should consist of a **map of objects**, where:
- The **key** is the medication name.
- The **value** is an object containing details about that medication.

For your submission, please include both your **code** and the **JSON bundle**.  

You may use any language or framework, though we recommend **JavaScript/TypeScript with Playwright or Puppeteer**.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install playwright
node extract.js
```

# What It Does
- Scrapes all medicines Aâ€“Z from NHS Medicines

Creates nhs-medicines.json with:
- Medicine descriptions and brand names
- Dosage instructions
- Side effects
- Who can/cannot take it
- Pregnancy information
- Drug interactions
- FAQs
