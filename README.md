# nhs-medicines-extractor

Problem Statement 

Criteria
The NHS has a list of medicines. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to extract this information into a JSON bundle. The JSON bundle should consist of a map of objects, the key being the medication name, with the object contents being details about that medication.

For your submission please include both your code and the JSON bundle. You are welcome to use any language or framework that youâ€™d like for this project, though we recommend javascript/typescript with Playwright or Puppeteer.
